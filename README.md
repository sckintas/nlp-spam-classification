## Introduction

This project implements a spam classification system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify messages into two categories: `spam` and `ham` (non-spam). The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) for feature extraction and machine learning algorithms for classification.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and irrelevant data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generates visual insights, including word clouds and class distributions.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts textual data into numerical representations using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW).
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, to classify messages.
- **Evaluation**: Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score for performance evaluation.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of SMS messages labeled as `spam` or `ham`. Each message is a single instance, with one column for the text and another for the label.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn
- Wordcloud

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations, such as:

- **Word Clouds** for spam and ham messages.
- **Class Distribution** plots to show dataset imbalance.
- **ROC Curves** to evaluate classification performance.

## Evaluation

Performance metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision and Recall**: To measure the modelâ€™s ability to identify spam messages.
- **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: To evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes.

### Results Summary

- **Accuracy**: 95%
- **Precision**: 92%
- **Recall**: 90%
- **F1-Score**: 91%
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.96

The results indicate strong performance in distinguishing between spam and ham messages, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented techniques.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional advanced NLP techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Test and compare more machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, and deep learning approaches.
- Implement a web interface for users to test the spam classifier.
